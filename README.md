## abd@abd:~$ cat projects.txt | grep mern

I have worked on these projects to improve my skills.
Projects are divided into two categories
- Self-made projects
- Clone projects

### Self-made projects
I made these projects from scratch by myself to grow my skill

### Clone projects
These include projects from different tutorials that I implemented to improve my understanding
